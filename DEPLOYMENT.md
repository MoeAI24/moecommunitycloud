# MCC Newsletter — Deploy Ready

## What you’re uploading
- `newsletter/index.html` — the newsletter archive page (subscribe via Gmail, search, share, RSS link)
- `newsletter/rss.xml` — RSS feed for the archive
- `newsletter.html` — optional redirect helper (lets you link `/newsletter.html` and land on `/newsletter/`)

## Where it will live
Recommended public URL:
- https://moecommunitycloud.com/newsletter/

## Link it from your main site (no guesswork)
Add a nav link to the main site:
- Label: **Newsletter**
- URL: **/newsletter/**

If you want a second backup link:
- URL: **/newsletter.html**

## GitHub upload layout
Put these files into your repo exactly like this:

/newsletter/index.html
/newsletter/rss.xml
/newsletter.html

Commit → push → done.
