Moe Community Cloud · Playbooks Hub (Root Site) – With Images
=========================================================

This version of the hub restores visual images for:
- Your Moe Bucks headshot in the header.
- Each playbook tile (Vertex, Retail, Smart Home, Edge & IoT, Vapor, Zero Trust).

Expected asset paths (you can rename these to match your existing assets folder):
- assets/moe-bucks-headshot.png
- assets/playbook-vertex.png
- assets/playbook-retail.png
- assets/playbook-smarthome.png
- assets/playbook-edge-iot.png
- assets/playbook-vapor.png
- assets/playbook-zero-trust.png

If your existing images live in a different folder or have different names:
- Just update the src="..." paths in index.html to match your real files.

Deploy:
1. Replace the current index.html at the root for https://moecommunitycloud.com/ with this version.
2. Make sure the assets/ folder containing your images is in the same root (or adjust paths).
3. Commit and push / redeploy.
