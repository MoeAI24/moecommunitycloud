            <p>
              My background blends military discipline, enterprise cloud, and content creation. I’ve seen
              first-hand how teams get stuck between experimentation and execution – especially with AI,
              agents, and edge computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              MBCC playbooks exist so we stop reinventing the wheel. Instead of a new slide deck or “AI
              POC” every quarter, you get reusable architectures, simulations, and offers you can run again
              and again.

          <h2>What is Vapor Cloud?</h2>
          <p>
            Vapor Cloud is the operating mindset behind MBCC: design systems that work locally, in hybrid
            mode, and on any major cloud. Instead of getting locked into one provider, we build for
            portability and resilience.
          </p>
          <p>
            That shows up in the playbooks as simulations, architectures, and blueprints that can run in
            Google Cloud first – then extend to other environments when needed.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="about-card">
          <h2>What is Agent-Ops™?</h2>
          <p>
            Agent-Ops is the DevOps of agentic AI: a framework for designing, observing, and controlling
            agents like real software – with blueprints, chains, risk models, and replay logs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Agent-Ops Playbook gives you a way to explain agents to executives, design them responsibly,
            and sell them as a real offer – with dashboards and guardrails instead of chaos.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="about-card">
          <h2>Why Playbooks?</h2>
          <p>
            A playbook is more than a deck. It’s a reusable system: story, architecture diagrams,
            simulations, scoping tools, and a proposal generator tied together.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means you can walk into a room with confidence, show “what good looks like” on screen,
            then turn the conversation into a real scoped engagement before you leave.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="about-card">
          <h2>The VCDL Path</h2>
          <p>
            Vapor Cloud Digital Leaders are the next wave of consultants, architects, and creators who
            use these playbooks as their weapon. You don’t have to build from scratch – you customize.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start with one playbook (Vertex, Edge, Zero Trust, Agent-Ops), land a win, then expand. Over
            time, you’ll build your own book of business powered by MBCC systems.
