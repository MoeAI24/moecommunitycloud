            <p>
              My background blends military discipline, enterprise cloud, and content creation. I’ve seen
              first-hand how teams get stuck between experimentation and execution – especially with AI,
              agents, and edge computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              MBCC playbooks exist so we stop reinventing the wheel. Instead of a new slide deck or “AI
              POC” every quarter, you get reusable architectures, simulations, and offers you can run again
              and again.

          <h2>What is Vapor Cloud?</h2>
          <p>
            Vapor Cloud is an operating mindset: design systems that can run locally, in hybrid mode, and
            on any major cloud. No lock-in, no brittle architectures – just resilient patterns that travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            For enterprises, that means production architectures that fit your governance and security
            model. For VCDLs, it means you can walk into any account with a portable story that works
            beyond one vendor logo.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="about-card">
          <h2>What is Agent-Ops™?</h2>
          <p>
            Agent-Ops is the DevOps of agentic AI: a way to design, observe, and control agents like real
            software – with blueprints, chains, risk models, and replay logs instead of “magic.”
          </p>
          <p>
            For enterprises, it turns agents into governed systems that security and ops can trust.
            For VCDLs, it turns agent projects into a repeatable offer backed by simulations and runbooks.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="about-card">
          <h2>Why Playbooks?</h2>
          <p>
            A playbook is more than a deck. It’s a reusable system: narrative, architecture diagrams,
            simulations, scoping tools, and a proposal generator that all line up.
          </p>
          <p>
            For enterprises, that means you see the architecture, the risk posture, and the path to
            production before you sign. For VCDLs, it means you show up with a complete offer, not just
            slides and hope.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="about-card">
          <h2>The VCDL Path</h2>
          <p>
            Vapor Cloud Digital Leaders are consultants, architects, and creators who use MBCC systems
            as their backbone. They don’t guess at what to sell next – the playbooks tell them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start with one playbook (Vertex, Edge, Zero Trust, Agent-Ops, or Bubble Crash Monetization),
            land a win, then expand. Over time you build a portfolio of offers, all powered by the same
            MBCC standards.
