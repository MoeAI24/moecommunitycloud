    <h1>Simulation Before Production</h1>
    <p class="subhead">Simulation-first rollout validates AI behavior under stress, outages, and uncertainty before real-world exposure.</p>
    
<h2>Production is not the place to learn failure modes</h2>
<p>
Every serious system ships with assumptions. AI systems ship with assumptions <i>and</i> uncertainty.
In production, that uncertainty becomes customer impact, security risk, or operational noise.
Simulation is how you learn cheaply — before real consequences appear.
</p>

<h2>What “simulation-first” means (without the buzzwords)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Replay</b>: run workflows against historical scenarios to see what the agent would do.</li>
  <li><b>Stress</b>: inject bad inputs, missing data, outages, and contradictory instructions.</li>
  <li><b>Measure</b>: capture decision paths, tool calls, latency, and escalation frequency.</li>
  <li><b>Refine</b>: tighten boundaries and authority until behavior is predictable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why enterprises need it</h2>
<p>
Enterprises don’t just need a system that works when everything is normal. They need a system that behaves acceptably when:
data is incomplete, tools fail, users contradict each other, or the environment changes.
Simulation is the only way to validate those conditions without paying for mistakes in public.
</p>

<h2>Simulation changes the conversation internally</h2>
<p>
Instead of arguing opinions, teams can review evidence:
what the agent did, why it did it, what it asked for, what it refused, and how often it escalated.
That evidence makes approvals faster — and governance more credible.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
Simulation-first doesn’t slow innovation. It prevents rework. It prevents policy theater.
It creates the confidence required to scale beyond a single pilot.
</p>

<h2>What MBCC provides</h2>
<p>
Public MBCC pages share outcomes and decision framing. Private delivery through the MBCC Client Vault includes implementation assets,
testing checklists, runbooks, and rollout governance aligned to your constraints.
</p>

    <div class="notice">
      Implementation assets (architectures, dashboards, templates, and runbooks) are delivered privately via the MBCC Client Vault after engagement or deposit.
